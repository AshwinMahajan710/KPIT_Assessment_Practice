1. For creating new exceptions no need to import any class as 'Exception' class is already imported by default 

2. type = BatteryType[LI_ION] --> to assign by 'Name' in enum class.   
   type = BatteryType(LI_ION) --> to assign by 'Value' in enum class.   

3. For multiple types in isinstance() always use tuple --> (int, float) and not list [int , float]. And as a type hint while accepting values in functions, use this --> int | float
